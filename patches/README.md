Apply these .ips patches to a clean Pokémon Red Version ROM.  
You can find one on your own, or build [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) to get one as well.

Included are v2.4.2 (monochrome) and v3.0.1 (full color, current official release).
There are no patches here for the rom that this repo actually builds (v4), as it is not playable yet.
